There are several different ways to implement a Field building block showing a link that might open a quick view.

## Field that Opens a QuickView Showing QuickViewFacets for an Entity

In our example, RootEntity has a 1:1 navigation property \_NavProp1 to NavEntity. NavEntity is annotated with UI.QuickViewFacets

You can implement a field that shows a quick view for NavEntity if you meet the following conditions:

-   you use a property that is a referential constraint of a 1:1 navigation pointing to NavEntity
-   you use a property that is a key or a semantic key of NavEntity via the navigation property

The quick view popup shows the following:

-   a Form for FieldGroup annotations defined in the UI.QuickViewFacets annotation
-   a Form for Contact annotations defined in UI.QuickViewFacets

## Implementing a Field that Opens a Contact Card

You can show a contact card by using a metapath that points to a DataFieldForAnnotation that in turn targets a Communication.Contact.
The field shows the full name of the contact person and clicking on it displays the contact card.
