I'm actually really surprised by the positive reviews, which I relied on when ordering.  It broke after 1 day. Poor Quality.  It is so horrible that I can't even believe it!  I'm a dummy for not throwing all in the trash.  Looks better than it works.  Honestly I have no clue what you had in mind when choosing to offer this product.  I have to say that I'm quite disappointed.  The Worst I have ever seen!  No instructions included for use or installation.  I want my money back!  Nice looking product, but never worked well.",

Excellent engineering and the feeling of a very high quality product.  I do really love this product and think it's a good buy.  After using that product my business skyrocketed!  Great quality and exactly what was described.  Everyone in my big family has one now - both adults, four teen and one middle schooler.  Unique and beautiful. Excellent quality. Great service.  Never saw a quality like that before.  Fantastic, I'm totally blown away.  That was a good choice, would definitely pick it again.",

It is fatally flawed and should be avoided.  Didn't receive what the picture looked like.  Didn't work, that is why I cannot recommend this product.  I don't recommend and will not purchase this brand again.  Design Fail! Not a happy customer.  Lower quality than expected.  Nice looking product, but never worked well.

Pretty looking product.  Quite ok -- nothing extraordinary, though.  If you're looking for something durable and heavy-duty I would not recommend this one.  Everything's working like it should.  For a straight up purchase not a bad choice.  I would recommend this item to anyone who wants it.  Does not look the same as the picture provided...which was disappointing, but ok.  I actually bought this for my dad when the old one was broken. He likes it.  I'am hoping that the product will continue to improve.  Not bad for the price I suppose.  Not expensive for the quality.

If you're looking for something durable and heavy-duty I would not recommend this one.  For a straight up purchase not a bad choice.  Material seems a bit cheaper than I had expected. It's okay.  Works as advertised.  Not expensive for the quality.  Haven't seen good alternatives, so I picked this one.  I received this as a gift, otherwise I would return it.  Nothing special to mention on this one.  Would buy a better quality next time.  I actually bought this for my dad when the old one was broken. He likes it.

I don't recommend and will not purchase this brand again.  Horrible! Unsatisfied in every way!  I'm a dummy for not throwing all in the trash.  Why is this even available here?  I should have read the reviews that warned about how short, or small, this product is.  Lower quality than expected.  Too expensive for what I received.  I'd expect a little more durability.  It is fatally flawed and should be avoided.  Not sure if I should even post one star....",

Never saw a quality like that before.  I've only had it a couple of days. So far I love it.  I was surprised how nice this product really looks.  Overall I am extremely pleased with it.  That was a good choice, would definitely pick it again.  Not expensive for the quality.  Fantastic, I'm totally blown away.  Simple and easy to use. Top Design.  Everyone in my big family has one now - both adults, four teen and one middle schooler.  It's convienent for me.  A great purchase, thank you!

Everyone in my big family has one now - both adults, four teen and one middle schooler.  Can't relate to the bad reviews I saw, I definitely like it.  I've only had it a couple of days. So far I love it.  After using that product my business skyrocketed!  Excellent engineering and the feeling of a very high quality product.  I was surprised how nice this product really looks.  Overall I am extremely pleased with it.  Definitely worth the investment.  Why didn't I buy these sooner? Such a cool Design!",

It serves the intended purpose.  Would buy a better quality next time.  Material seems a bit cheaper than I had expected. It's okay.  Good product for the money.  It does it's job.  Go for it, not really bad at all.  Adorable, but expensive.  I actually bought this for my dad when the old one was broken. He likes it.  Does not look the same as the picture provided...which was disappointing, but ok.  Works fine, but it is fragile...  Not expensive for the quality.  As expected, no surprises ;-)  Not bad for the price I suppose.  Product functions as advertised.",

Great quality and exactly what was described.  After using that product my business skyrocketed!  It's convienent for me.  Everyone in my big family has one now - both adults, four teen and one middle schooler.  This product is incredible awesome!  A great purchase, thank you!  Sleek product!",

I'd expect a little more durability.  Reading these reviews, I really had to wonder if I had bought the same product.  Just don't spend your time on considering it.  I'm actually really surprised by the positive reviews, which I relied on when ordering.  I don't recommend and will not purchase this brand again.  Called customer service..no answer.  I'm a dummy for not throwing all in the trash.  The Worst I have ever seen!  Honestly I have no clue what you had in mind when choosing to offer this product.  I have to say that I'm quite disappointed.  We were able to return it for a full refund.  So expensive. ...you can buy the same product for less money :(  Didn't work, that is why I cannot recommend this product.",

I should have read the reviews that warned about how short, or small, this product is.  Why is this even available here?  Called customer service..no answer.  I don't recommend and will not purchase this brand again.  So expensive. ...you can buy the same product for less money :(  It broke after 1 day. Poor Quality.  Looks better than it works.",

I was surprised how nice this product really looks.  I looked around quite a bit before deciding to try this and it fulfills all that I wanted.   A great purchase, thank you!  Can't relate to the bad reviews I saw, I definitely like it.  This product has changed my life.   Fantastic, I'm totally blown away.  This is great!  I love it so much.  Sleek product!  Everyone in my big family has one now - both adults, four teen and one middle schooler.",

It is so horrible that I can't even believe it!  Lower quality than expected.  Just don't spend your time on considering it.  No instructions included for use or installation.  Called customer service..no answer.  Looks better than it works.  Didn't work, that is why I cannot recommend this product.

Nice looking product, but never worked well.  The description is wrong. I sent it back.  Honestly I have no clue what you had in mind when choosing to offer this product.  We were able to return it for a full refund.  I have to say that I'm quite disappointed.  I'm a dummy for not throwing all in the trash.  No instructions included for use or installation.

Works fine, but it is fragile...  Haven't seen good alternatives, so I picked this one.  Product functions as advertised.  Pretty looking product.  Packaging is not the same as getting it from the website.  Not expensive for the quality.  Good product for the money.  Go for it, not really bad at all.  Lower quality than expected.  Quite ok -- nothing extraordinary, though.  Not bad for the price I suppose.  I would recommend this item to anyone who wants it.",

Everything's working like it should.  Quite ok -- nothing extraordinary, though.  It does it's job.  Product functions as advertised.  Does not look the same as the picture provided...which was disappointing, but ok.  Would buy a better quality next time.  I would recommend this item to anyone who wants it.  For a straight up purchase not a bad choice.  Lower quality than expected.  Not bad for the price I suppose.  Not good, not bad.  Works as advertised.  Go for it, not really bad at all.",

Fantastic, I'm totally blown away.  Simple and easy to use. Top Design.  I love it so much.  This is great!  Can't relate to the bad reviews I saw, I definitely like it.  After using that product my business skyrocketed!  Why didn't I buy these sooner? Such a cool Design!  Overall I am extremely pleased with it.  Definitely worth the investment.  Excellent engineering and the feeling of a very high quality product.  I've only had it a couple of days. So far I love it.  Great idea, I can use this for more than I expected.  Perfect for my needs.  Not expensive for the quality.",

For a straight up purchase not a bad choice.  Not good, not bad.  I cannot say as that it's perfect!  It does it's job.  It serves the intended purpose.  I received this as a gift, otherwise I would return it.  If you're looking for something durable and heavy-duty I would not recommend this one.  I'am hoping that the product will continue to improve.  I didn't bother to return it but will not be purchasing this again.  Not bad for the price I suppose.  I actually bought this for my dad when the old one was broken. He likes it.  Nothing special to mention on this one.  Adorable, but expensive.  Material seems a bit cheaper than I had expected.

Why didn't I buy these sooner? Such a cool Design!  Everyone in my big family has one now - both adults, four teen and one middle schooler.  Can't relate to the bad reviews I saw, I definitely like it.  Does what it should, so definitely deserves a good rating.  I looked around quite a bit before deciding to try this and it fulfills all that I wanted.   Perfect for my needs.  Never saw a quality like that before.  Overall I am extremely pleased with it.

I'm a dummy for not throwing all in the trash.  I'd expect a little more durability.  Lower quality than expected.  Didn't receive what the picture looked like.  It is so horrible that I can't even believe it!  Called customer service..no answer.  It is fatally flawed and should be avoided.  The description is wrong. I sent it back.  Reading these reviews, I really had to wonder if I had bought the same product.  Horrible! Unsatisfied in every way!  Looks better than it works.  So expensive. ...you can buy the same product for less money :(",

Does what it should, so definitely deserves a good rating.  Excellent engineering and the feeling of a very high quality product.  Simple and easy to use. Top Design.  Not expensive for the quality.

Reading these reviews, I really had to wonder if I had bought the same product.  Too expensive for what I received.  Honestly I have no clue what you had in mind when choosing to offer this product.  Horrible! Unsatisfied in every way!  Not recommending to anyone. Very cheap.  So expensive. ...you can buy the same product for less money :(  I'd expect a little more durability.  Not sure if I should even post one star....  Just don't spend your time on considering it.  We were able to return it for a full refund.  I'm a dummy for not throwing all in the trash.",

I'm actually really surprised by the positive reviews, which I relied on when ordering.  I have to say that I'm quite disappointed.  Nice looking product, but never worked well.  Didn't work, that is why I cannot recommend this product.  It is so horrible that I can't even believe it!  I don't recommend and will not purchase this brand again.  I'd expect a little more durability.  It is fatally flawed and should be avoided.",

Go for it, not really bad at all.  For a straight up purchase not a bad choice.  Quite ok -- nothing extraordinary, though.  It does it's job.  Lower quality than expected.  Product functions as advertised.  It serves the intended purpose.  I actually bought this for my dad when the old one was broken. He likes it.

Speachless!  Fantastic, I'm totally blown away.  Everyone in my big family has one now - both adults, four teen and one middle schooler.  I was surprised how nice this product really looks.  Unique and beautiful. Excellent quality. Great service.",

Reading these reviews, I really had to wonder if I had bought the same product.  So expensive. ...you can buy the same product for less money :(  We were able to return it for a full refund.  Lower quality than expected.  No instructions included for use or installation.  Not sure if I should even post one star....  The description is wrong. I sent it back.  Called customer service..no answer.  I'm a dummy for not throwing all in the trash.  It is fatally flawed and should be avoided.  Not recommending to anyone. Very cheap.",

Overall I am extremely pleased with it.  Everyone in my big family has one now - both adults, four teen and one middle schooler.  Great idea, I can use this for more than I expected.

Not sure if I should even post one star....  Design Fail! Not a happy customer.  Why is this even available here?  Honestly I have no clue what you had in mind when choosing to offer this product.  Too expensive for what I received.  It is so horrible that I can't even believe it!  I'd expect a little more durability.  We were able to return it for a full refund.

Great idea, I can use this for more than I expected.  After using that product my business skyrocketed!  This product is incredible awesome!  A great purchase, thank you!  I've only had it a couple of days. So far I love it.  Excellent engineering and the feeling of a very high quality product.  Overall I am extremely pleased with it.  I was surprised how nice this product really looks.  Everyone in my big family has one now - both adults, four teen and one middle schooler.  Sleek product!  Great quality and exactly what was described.  Simple and easy to use. Top Design.  I looked around quite a bit before deciding to try this and it fulfills all that I wanted.   Definitely worth the investment.  Fantastic, I'm totally blown away.",

I looked around quite a bit before deciding to try this and it fulfills all that I wanted.   It looks beautiful and modern.  Why didn't I buy these sooner? Such a cool Design!  I've only had it a couple of days. So far I love it.  Overall I am extremely pleased with it.  Can't relate to the bad reviews I saw, I definitely like it.  Wow, wow, wow. Speachless!

Can't relate to the bad reviews I saw, I definitely like it.  The good things are still available, this is the proof!  Definitely worth the investment.  Does what it should, so definitely deserves a good rating.  I've only had it a couple of days. So far I love it.  They hold up and last a very long time.  Everyone in my big family has one now - both adults, four teen and one middle schooler.  I looked around quite a bit before deciding to try this and it fulfills all that I wanted.

That was a good choice, would definitely pick it again.  Why didn't I buy these sooner? Such a cool Design!  I do really love this product and think it's a good buy.

Packaging is not the same as getting it from the website.  As expected, no surprises ;-)  I didn't bother to return it but will not be purchasing this again.  Everything's working like it should.  Go for it, not really bad at all.",

We were able to return it for a full refund.  I'm a dummy for not throwing all in the trash.  Looks better than it works.  Called customer service..no answer.  Just don't spend your time on considering it.  Nice looking product, but never worked well.  I'm actually really surprised by the positive reviews, which I relied on when ordering.

I'm a dummy for not throwing all in the trash.  Nice looking product, but never worked well.  Not sure if I should even post one star....  Just don't spend your time on considering it.  Horrible!

The good things are still available, this is the proof!  I would buy this product again, if I ever need too, big smile.  Wow, wow, wow. Speachless!  That was a good choice, would definitely pick it again.  After using that product my business skyrocketed!  Great idea, I can use this for more than I expected.  Not expensive for the quality.  Excellent engineering and the feeling of a very high quality product.  I looked around quite a bit before deciding to try this and it fulfills all that I wanted.

I was surprised how nice this product really looks.  Does what it should, so definitely deserves a good rating.  That was a good choice, would definitely pick it again.  I love it so much.  I've only had it a couple of days. So far I love it.  I do really love this product and think it's a good buy.  I would buy this product again, if I ever need too, big smile.",

Everyone in my big family has one now - both adults, four teen and one middle schooler.  Not expensive for the quality.  Why didn't I buy these sooner? Such a cool Design!  After using that product my business skyrocketed!  I've only had it a couple of days. So far I love it.  That was a good choice, would definitely pick it again.  Fantastic, I'm totally blown away.  Never saw a quality like that before.  They hold up and last a very long time.  Sleek product!  Great quality and exactly what was described.",

I'd expect a little more durability.  Called customer service..no answer.  Looks better than it works.  I don't recommend and will not purchase this brand again.

Material seems a bit cheaper than I had expected. It's okay.  For a straight up purchase not a bad choice.  I actually bought this for my dad when the old one was broken. He likes it.  Does not look the same as the picture provided...which was disappointing, but ok.  Not expensive for the quality.  As expected, no surprises ;-)  I didn't bother to return it but will not be purchasing this again.  Good product for the money.  Works as advertised.  Go for it, not really bad at all.  If you're looking for something durable and heavy-duty I would not recommend this one.  Quite ok -- nothing extraordinary, though.  I'am hoping that the product will continue to improve.

I looked around quite a bit before deciding to try this and it fulfills all that I wanted.   I was surprised how nice this product really looks.  That was a good choice, would definitely pick it again.  Unique and beautiful. Excellent quality. Great service.

That was a good choice, would definitely pick it again.  Never saw a quality like that before.  They hold up and last a very long time.  After using that product my business skyrocketed!  Perfect for my needs.  Not expensive for the quality.  Great quality and exactly what was described.  Does what it should, so definitely deserves a good rating.  I love it so much.

Why is this even available here?  So expensive. ...you can buy the same product for less money :(  Just don't spend your time on considering it.  It is so horrible that I can't even believe it!

Not a happy customer.  We were able to return it for a full refund.  Looks better than it works.  Not sure if I should even post one star....  Horrible! Unsatisfied in every way!  It is fatally flawed and should be avoided.  I'm a dummy for not throwing all in the trash.  The Worst I have ever seen!  It broke after 1 day. Poor Quality.

Just don't spend your time on considering it.  So expensive. ...you can buy the same product for less money :(  I don't recommend and will not purchase this brand again.  Horrible! Unsatisfied in every way!  Called customer service..no answer.  Too expensive for what I received.  Not sure if I should even post one star....  Not recommending to anyone. Very cheap.

Called customer service..no answer.  Nice looking product, but never worked well.  Honestly I have no clue what you had in mind when choosing to offer this product.  Not sure if I should even post one star....  We were able to return it for a full refund.  Just don't spend your time on considering it.",

I don't recommend and will not purchase this brand again.  The Worst I have ever seen!  It broke after 1 day. Poor Quality.  Horrible! Unsatisfied in every way!  The description is wrong. I sent it back.  Reading these reviews, I really had to wonder if I had bought the same product.  I should have read the reviews that warned about how short, or small, this product is.

I didn't bother to return it but will not be purchasing this again.  Works fine, but it is fragile...  Not expensive for the quality.  I would recommend this item to anyone who wants it.  As expected, no surprises ;-)  Material seems a bit cheaper than I had expected. It's okay.  Go for it, not really bad at all.  It does it's job.  Does not look the same as the picture provided...which was disappointing, but ok.  Would buy a better quality next time.  I'am hoping that the product will continue to improve.",

Unsatisfied in every way!  I'd expect a little more durability.  Lower quality than expected.  It is so horrible that I can't even believe it!  Honestly I have no clue what you had in mind when choosing to offer this product.  Why is this even available here?  It broke after 1 day. Poor Quality.  We were able to return it for a full refund.  The Worst I have ever seen!  Not sure if I should even post one star....",

I received this as a gift, otherwise I would return it.  It serves the intended purpose.  Does not look the same as the picture provided...which was disappointing, but ok.  Adorable, but expensive.  Good product for the money.  As expected, no surprises ;-)",

Reading these reviews, I really had to wonder if I had bought the same product.  I don't recommend and will not purchase this brand again.  Too expensive for what I received.  Not recommending to anyone. Very cheap.  I'd expect a little more durability.  Looks better than it works.  Nice looking product, but never worked well.  It is fatally flawed and should be avoided.

Why didn't I buy these sooner? Such a cool Design!  Excellent engineering and the feeling of a very high quality product.  Great quality and exactly what was described.  Never saw a quality like that before.  The good things are still available, this is the proof!  Everyone in my big family has one now - both adults, four teen and one middle schooler.

I'd expect a little more durability.  Not sure if I should even post one star....  I should have read the reviews that warned about how short, or small, this product is.  It broke after 1 day.

Unsatisfied in every way!  Nice looking product, but never worked well.  Design Fail! Not a happy customer.  It is so horrible that I can't even believe it!  This is a role model for annoying a customer.  Looks better than it works.  Didn't work, that is why I cannot recommend this product.  We were able to return it for a full refund.  Reading these reviews, I really had to wonder if I had bought the same product.  I'm actually really surprised by the positive reviews, which I relied on when ordering.  Why is this even available here?",

The Worst I have ever seen!  Horrible! Unsatisfied in every way!  This is a role model for annoying a customer.  Just don't spend your time on considering it.  Honestly I have no clue what you had in mind when choosing to offer this product.  We were able to return it for a full refund.  Didn't receive what the picture looked like.  Not sure if I should even post one star....  I don't recommend and will not purchase this brand again.  Didn't work, that is why I cannot recommend this product.",

I'am hoping that the product will continue to improve.  I cannot say as that it's perfect!  I actually bought this for my dad when the old one was broken. He likes it.

So expensive. ...you can buy the same product for less money :(  I'm actually really surprised by the positive reviews, which I relied on when ordering.  Not sure if I should even post one star....  Design Fail! Not a happy customer.",

Reading these reviews, I really had to wonder if I had bought the same product.  Not recommending to anyone. Very cheap.  I should have read the reviews that warned about how short, or small, this product is.  I'm actually really surprised by the positive reviews, which I relied on when ordering.  It broke after 1 day. Poor Quality.  Horrible! Unsatisfied in every way!  Didn't receive what the picture looked like.  I'm a dummy for not throwing all in the trash.  Didn't work, that is why I cannot recommend this product.  Lower quality than expected.",
