						as the document character set.</p>
					<p>We also give our app a title that will be displayed in the browser. Our hard-coded title can be overruled by the app, for
						example to show a title in the language of the user. The body part describes the layout of the page. In our case, we simply
						display "Hello World" by using a <code>div</code> tag.</p>

			<h2 class="title ">webapp/manifest.json (New)</h2>
			<p>The manifest file, also known as the "descriptor" or "app descriptor," serves as a crucial
				configuration file for applications, components, and libraries. Stored in the
					<code>webapp</code> folder, this file is read by SAPUI5 to instantiate a
				component. Although we haven't created a component yet (which is part of <a href="topic/f9d0e2fcd2134ff7923fcdcba8bded96" title="After we have introduced all three parts of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) concept, we now come to another important structural aspect of SAPUI5." class="sap-doc">Step 9: Component Configuration (TypeScript)</a>), we need to create the app
				descriptor now because the UI5 Tooling we intend to use for development also
				requires it.</p>
			<p>Hence, we create a new file named <code>manifest.json</code> in the webapp folder and define its essential attributes:</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">The <code>_version</code> attribute is a mandatory field in the app descriptor that indicates the format version of the descriptor. This
						attribute is crucial for identifying application settings when the descriptor is read by various tools. As new features or
						changes are introduced in future versions of the descriptor, the version number helps to ensure compatibility and proper
						interpretation of the descriptor's contents. Consequently, with each new version of SAPUI5 a corresponding version of the app descriptor is released.
						For this tutorial, we have determined that our app requires a minimum SAPUI5 version of 1.128. Therefore, we specify the descriptor
						format version as 1.65.0, aligning it with the appropriate SAPUI5 version.<div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
							</p><p>To find the appropriate <code>_version</code> for each SAPUI5 release, see <a href="topic/be0cf40f61184b358b5faedaec98b2da" title="The manifest (also known as descriptor for applications, components, and libraries, in short: app descriptor) is inspired by the WebApplication Manifest concept introduced by the W3C. The manifest provides a central, machine-readable, and easy-to-access location for storing metadata associated with an application, an application component, or a library." class="sap-doc">Manifest (Descriptor for Applications, Components, and Libraries)</a>.</p>

					<li class="li">
						<p>The <span class="emphasis"><code>sap.app</code></span> namespace is used to define properties that are specific to the
							application itself. It includes the following obligatory application-specific attributes:</p><ul class="ul ">
								<li class="li">
									<p><code>id</code>: This property specifies a unique identifier for the application and states the namespace
										of the application. It's used to identify the application within the SAP Fiori launchpad or any other
										deployment environment. The <code>id</code> has to be provided in dot notation and must not exceed 70
										characters.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="li">
									<p><code>title</code>: This property defines the title of the application, which can be displayed in the SAP
										Fiori launchpad or other application management tools.</p><div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
											</p><p>It's recommended to make the title language-dependent, although for now we use a static title. We'll
												discuss how to implement language-dependent titles in <a href="topic/2a46b7567a73457c81b1b67741146063" title="All application-specific configuration settings will now further be put in a separate descriptor file called manifest.json.

										<p></p></div></div><p></p>
								</li>
								<li class="li">
									<p><code>applicationVersion</code>: This property is used to specify the version of the application. It's
										typically used for tracking and managing changes to the application over time. The application version must be
										provided using semantic versioning principles.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="li">
									<p><code>type</code>: This property defines the type of your project, such as <code>application</code> or
											<code>component</code>. It helps in determining the project's behavior and how it should be loaded.
										While the type is actually not a mandatory attribute, it provides a useful project description; hence, it
										makes sense to configure it as well. We describe an <code>application</code> here.</p>

				and execute the following command:<p></p>
			<p><code>npm install --save-dev @ui5/cli</code></p>
			<p>Finally, we initialize the UI5 Tooling configuration for our project by executing the following command on the app root folder:</p>
			<p><code>ui5 init</code></p>
			<p>This generates a <code>ui5.yaml</code> file in our app root directory, which is essential for using UI5 Tooling with our project.</p>
			<p>To start the web server, execute the following command:</p>
			<p><code>npm start</code></p>
			<p>This opens a new browser window hosting your newly created <code>index.html</code>.</p>
