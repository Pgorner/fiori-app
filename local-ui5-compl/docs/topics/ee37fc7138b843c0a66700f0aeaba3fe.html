			<section>
				<h3 class="title ">WCAG 2.2</h3>
				<p>To ensure better accessibility experience and to adhere to the Web Content Accessibility
					Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2, it is important for developers and designers to follow
					specific guidelines. When working with SAPUI5 controls, refer to the SAP
					Fiori for Web design guidelines corresponding to the specific control you are
					using. The design guidelines provide detailed information on how each control
					should be implemented to meet accessibility requirements. For example for the
						<code>sap.m.Object</code> controls, see <a href="https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/object-display-elements/" title="https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/object-display-elements/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Object Display Components Fiori Guidelines</a>.</p>

				<h3 class="title ">Don't change the HTML</h3>
				<p>Theming (CSS selectors), keyboard handling (tab order) and screen reader support
					are tightly coupled with the HTML structure of the generated pages. If you
					change the structure of the elements (for example, from custom JavaScript, HTML
					or CSS), this could break some or all of the accessibility aspects. In addition,
					it makes debugging the application more difficult.</p>
			</section><section>
				<h3 class="title ">Initial focus position</h3>
				<p>Within an application, the initial focus should be placed on the element that is
					most likely to be edited or interacted with first (for example, mandatory fields
					on a form). </p>
				<p>When opening dialogs or new pages, the focus should be on the first focusable
					element inside the content area.</p>
				<div class="note tip  "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Tip
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
					</p><p>On touch devices, if the first focusable element is a control that would open
						the soft keyboard, it is better to place the focus elsewhere - on the footer
						of the dialog or on a control that requires no keyboard input.</p>
					<p>A good practice is to set the focus on the first mandatory element. </p>
				<p></p></div></div>
			</section><section>
				<h3 class="title ">Don't interfere with existing accessibility
					features</h3>
				<p>Overriding code, for example the keyboard tab order or SAPUI5 key handlers, will impact the correct
					handling and may break the accessibility of the whole application.</p>
			</section><section>
				<h3 class="title ">Make sure that each component has a unique ID</h3>
				<p>The SAPUI5 framework handles the
					creation of unique IDs automatically. If you pass IDs yourself, make sure that
					they are unique within the whole application. For more information, see the
						<cite>Related Information</cite> section. </p>
			</section><section>
				<h3 class="title ">Tooltips for container controls</h3>
				<p>Container and layout controls such as <code>VerticalLayout</code> or
						<code>Grid</code> inherit the tooltip property from
						<code>sap.ui.core.Element</code>. </p><div class="note tip  "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Tip
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
						</p><p>We do not recommend setting a tooltip for the whole layout control, as it
							will not be displayed. You can set the needed tooltips for the
							individual controls which the container holds. </p>
					<p></p></div></div><p></p>

					Tip
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
				</p><p>If you are developing your own controls, follow the guidelines listed under
						<cite>Related Information</cite>.</p>
			<p></p></div></div></section><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Tips for Testing</h2>
			<p>Start the application and check each screen element. Check the following:</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">
						<p>Does it have a label or a tooltip (hover with the mouse)? </p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Are the labels and tooltips (fully) visible, clear, accurate, and
								meaningful?</p><ul class="ul ">
								<li class="li">
									<p>Is this also true for each input field or for a sequence of
										input fields? (For example: street and number)?</p>
								</li>
								<li class="li">
									<p>Is this also true for buttons, icons and images?</p>
								</li>
								<li class="li">
									<p>Is this also true for grouped information?</p>
								</li>
							</ul><p></p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Is the user informed about the required entries and input?</p>
					</li>
				</ul><p></p>
