		<h2 class="title ">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</h2> 
		<p>Usually the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> for security reasons only allows accessing
				resources from the same domain as the originating document. As there are a lot of
				web-based services available today, starting with RSS or Atom feeds, WebServices or
				OData services, there is a need to be able to also access data sources from
				different domains within the browser, which was addressed with the CORS
				(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) standard. This allows the server to set special
				headers on their responses, which are telling the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>
				object, whether it is allowed to process the requested data or not. </p> 
		<p>This CORS capability also plays an important role
			in SAPUI5 based applications. In case the application itself and the data
		  visualized are coming from different servers, the CORS header has to be
		  configured correctly on the data providing server, to allow the application
		  server domain to access the data. 
		</p> 
				<p>SAPUI5 is using CORS header on its CDN based
		  library to be able to load additional scripts, styles, and resources from the
		  CDN server.
