		controls and want to provide personalization and key user adaptation to your users, you
		should enable your controls for SAPUI5 flexibility.</div><p>SAPUI5 flexibility offers a set of actions that users can perform on UI elements, like
			moving, removing, or renaming them. SAPUI5 flexibility defines how these actions
			can be performed in a way that business users can understand easily (WYSIWYG behavior). SAPUI5 flexibility creates overlays, registers event handlers, and displays context
			menus and dialogs consistently across controls.</p><p>This guide is aimed at control developers looking to enable their controls for SAPUI5 flexibility and application developers who want to influence control
			behavior in their applications (usually to exclude certain controls from adaptation, or to restrict certain actions). </p><p>Among others, SAPUI5 Flexibility includes the following::</p><ul class="ul ">
			<li class="li">Key user adaptation</li>
			<li class="li">Personalization</li>
		</ul><p>For key user adaptation and personalization to work, they need different control-specific information.</p><section id="section_lyb_vst_qbc">
			<h2 class="title ">Enabling Controls for Key User Adaptation</h2>
			<p>Here's what you have to provide to enable your SAPUI5 controls for key user
				adaptation actions:</p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">
					<p><span class="emphasis">Design-time metadata</span></p>
					<p>Design-time metadata is a description of the actions that are possible for a control. Usually this is a file of the format
							<code>&lt;control_name&gt;.designtime.js</code>. See <a href="topic/5866a476fa4445ec953181354b383097" title="Design-time metadata is defined as an SAPUI5 module. It can contain static information, such as a description of properties or aggregations, as well as executable functions that are called by design-time tools." class="sap-doc">Providing Design-Time Metadata</a>.</p>
					<p>Design-time metadata can also be set for instances of controls to override the predefined behavior. See <a href="topic/8fa23241746c45eab2bce0c1e33305da" title="If you want to change the adaptability of a control in a specific instance only, you can provide instance-specific design-time metadata." class="sap-doc">Instance-Specific Design-Time Metadata</a>.</p>
					<p>The information contained in design-time metadata is relevant for key user adaptation as well as in SAP Business Application Studio.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p><span class="emphasis">Change handlers</span></p>
					<p>Change handlers are classes containing the logic to apply the information contained in a <code>.change</code> file to
						the control. The change handler interface is defined in <a href="topic/139a71f866ad4692a3af9023c089998a" title="Here's how you write a change handler." class="sap-doc">Implementing a Change Handler</a>. </p>
					<p>Change handlers are used for all personas of SAPUI5 flexibility - developers, key users, and end users - and can be reused, if
						an action is available for multiple personas.</p>
					<p> For many actions, SAPUI5 flexibility provides default change
						handlers that you can register. See <a href="topic/d5f4de8c177448e7aeb8e560e6061776" title="d5f4de8c177448e7aeb8e560e6061776.xml" class="sap-doc">Registering Change Handlers for UI Changes</a>. </p>
					<p>If the default handler for an action does not satisfy your requirements, you can develop your own change handlers. See <a href="topic/6a346a293c724bd4bc33f0df92706008" title="If no default change handler is available for your use case, you need to implement your own custom change handler." class="sap-doc">Writing a Custom Change Handler</a>.</p>

			<h2 class="title ">Enabling Controls for Personalization</h2>
			<p>Here's what you have to provide to enable your SAPUI5 controls for
				personalization actions:</p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">
					<p><span class="emphasis">Provide the UI</span></p>
					<p>The controls need to provide the UI to trigger the application and creation of personalization changes. The save can be handled
						in two ways: either by the control itself or or by the responsible variant management.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p><span class="emphasis">Call the specific personalization APIs to handle the changes</span></p>
					<p>The <span class="keynote apiname">ControlPersonalizationWriteAPI</span> provides all the required methods to handle the personalization changes.
