			amount. This can be done using the standard semantic colors that are defined for states
			like <span class="ph uicontrol">Success</span>, <span class="ph uicontrol">Warning</span>, or
				<span class="ph uicontrol">Error</span>.</p><p>The price values can be mapped to semantic states as follows:</p><ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">
					<p>price &lt; 50: Status is green (<span class="ph uicontrol">Success</span>)</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>price &gt;= 50 and price &lt; 250: Status is normal
							(<span class="ph uicontrol">None</span>)</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>price &gt;= 250 and price &lt; 2000: Status is orange
							(<span class="ph uicontrol">Warning</span>)</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>price &gt;= 2000: Status is red (<span class="ph uicontrol">Error</span>) </p>
				</li>
			</ul><p></p><p>As we use Test Driven Development (TDD) we define the test case first, before we actually
			implement the feature. So we will now start by implementing a test for the
				<span class="ph uicontrol">Price State</span> feature. Naturally the test will fail until the
			feature is implemented in the next step.</p><div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>

				</p><p>Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development model that relies on a
					very short development cycle. When using TDD a developer first writes a failing
					automatic test case to describe the behavior of a new feature or functionality.
					As soon as the test fails (due to the still missing implementation) the role of
					the developer switches to the implementation. The code is added to make the test
					run successful and then the cycle starts over again.</p>
				<p>There might also be iterations where just the implementation or testing code is
					refactored to make it more elegant. TDD reduces complexity while maintaining
					high test coverage of the application coding at the same time.</p>

			<p>First we think about the feature that we want to implement. We want to introduce a
				new state for the price, and its value should depend on certain price ranges. SAPUI5 controls
				typically have semantic states like <span class="ph uicontrol">Success</span>,
					<span class="ph uicontrol">Warning</span>, or <span class="ph uicontrol">Error</span>. We will need
				this formatter function to convert the numeric price value from the model to a state
				value for the control. But without caring too much about the actual implementation
				of this formatter we just add an empty function <code>priceState</code> to the
				formatter file for now and focus on the unit tests first.</p>

sap.ui.define([

	QUnit.module("Number unit");
		// …
	<span class="emphasis">QUnit.module("Price State");

	function priceStateTestCase(oOptions) {

	QUnit.test("Should format the products with a price lower than 50 to Success", function (assert) {

		});
	});</span>
});
</pre></div></div></section>
			<p>Now we write tests that call the function we have just defined and check for the
				correct result when passing in various arguments. </p>
			<p>By writing these tests, we actually implement the following specification in our
				tests that was defined by the product team.</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">
						<p>price &lt; 50: Status is green (<span class="ph uicontrol">Success</span>)</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>price &gt;= 50 and price &lt; 250: Status is normal
								(<span class="ph uicontrol">None</span>)</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>price &gt;= 250 and price &lt; 2000: Status is orange
								(<span class="ph uicontrol">Warning</span>)</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>price &gt;= 2000: Status is red (<span class="ph uicontrol">Error</span>) </p>
					</li>
				</ul><p></p>
			<p>Whenever we run the tests, we will implicitly check that the feature is still working
				as it was designed. To keep it simple, we should only write a minimum set of tests
				that cover the most important cases, but also including edge cases like the value 50
				or unexpected values. </p>
			<p>Let's have a look at the implementation of the unit tests now: We add our unit tests
				to the <code>webapp/test/unit/model/formatter.js</code> file. The path below
				the app and the test folder is similar so it can easily associate the test with the
				tested functionality. There are already formatter functions for the number unit
				conversion defined in the code - you can have a quick look before we add our own
				tests.</p>
			<p>We add a new QUnit module for our price state tests after the number unit conversion
				tests. We could write a test checking the result of the formatter for each of these
				cases but we do not want to repeat ourselves ("DRY") – neither in the tests nor
				in the application coding – so we create a reuse function called
					<code>priceStateTestCase</code>. In this function, we call the formatter
				with the arguments provided as <code>oOptions</code> and make a
					<code>strictEqual</code> assertion for the expected parameter.</p><div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
					</p><p>There must be at least one assertion per QUnit test. If the actual value
						matches the expected value then the test is successful. However, if there
						are more assertions in a test case and a subsequent assertion fails, the
						whole test fails with the error message of the failed assertion.</p>
					<p>There are also other types of assertions, for example the <code>ok</code>
						assertion that does not check the type. For more details, have a look at the
						official QUnit documentation. </p>
				<p></p></div></div><p></p>
			<p>The assert object – a special object injected by QUnit – is passed on as a reference to the
				function. QUnit is loaded once for the whole unit testing part of the app. </p>
			<p> And now for the actual test cases: Whenever we want to start a new test we call
					<code>QUnit.test</code> with a test description and a callback function
				containing the test logic as an argument. The callback is invoked with a special
				assert object that is maintained by QUnit. We can simply call assertions as we saw
				above. </p>
			<p>Inside each test we simply call our reuse function with different parameters for the
				price and the expected state that reflect our specification above. With five tests
				we can check the most important cases for our price state converter. There are four
				tests for the four different states and one edge case test with the value
					<code>50</code>, that makes sure that the correct state is chosen.</p>
			<p>That's it, you just wrote your first unit test. When you run the test in your browser, you can
				see that the first module for the number unit formatter is still green but our price
				state tests are red and failing. The error message tells us that the result of the
				empty formatter function is not as expected.</p>
			<p>TDD methodology tells us to do the implementation as soon as the test fails and to
				come back to testing as soon as the tests are successful again. You run the unit
				tests after each code change, and you're done when the test does not fail anymore.
				We now switch to the implementation part and define the details of the formatter
				function in the next step.</p>
