Otherwise key user changes will				get lost as soon as the app is reloaded. Asynchronous loading is a good idea anyway to improve the performance of your app, but make				sure that asynchronicity is in place when you use stashing. For more information, see the <a href="api/sap.uxap.ObjectPageLazyLoader" title="api/sap.uxap.ObjectPageLazyLoader" class="sap-doc" alt="api/sap.uxap.ObjectPageLazyLoader">API Reference for <code>sap.uxap.ObjectPageLazyLoader</code></a>				 as well as <a href="topic/68d0e58857a647d49470d9f92dd859bd" title="To instantiate views asychronously, SAPUI5 provides the factory method View.create defined in module sap/ui/core/mvc/View." class="sap-doc">Instantiating Views</a></p>		</section><section id="section_ControllerCode">			<h2 class="title ">Controller Code</h2>			<p>Normally, UI changes should win over binding and application coding. However, there is no distinct point in time when all controls are				available. This consequently means that there is also no single event when all changes have been applied, because, for example, new				changes can be introduced through user interactions.</p>			<p>The following mechanisms ensure that changes usually win over application coding:</p><ul class="ul ">					<li class="li">For controls in the XML view, changes are applied during the XML view processing.</li>					<li class="li">For controls that are created by your controller code, for example controls that are part of a group and are later placed inside an existing						control, the changes are applied when the control is added to the SAPUI5 control tree.</li>				</ul><p></p>			<p>However, with too many complexities or dynamics in the controller code, you can inadvertently overrule changes done by the key user.				Example: If a key user removes (i.e., hides) a control and your controller code overwrites its visibility property afterwards, the key				user change doesn't have an effect. If you cannot avoid this case because of some app-specific reasons, you should at least restrict				the availability of certain actions as described under <a href="topic/de9fd55c69af4b46863f5d26b5d796c4.html#loiode9fd55c69af4b46863f5d26b5d796c4/section_restrictadaptation" title="de9fd55c69af4b46863f5d26b5d796c4.xml#loiode9fd55c69af4b46863f5d26b5d796c4/section_restrictadaptation" class="sap-doc">Restrict Adaptation for Certain Controls</a>.</p>			<p>Keep in mind that the positions of controls can change if the key user moves them on the UI. Controls might end up in different				aggregations and at different index positions from what you specified. Therefore, you should only access controls by their ID. </p>			<p>				</p><div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>If you access <code>ObjectPageSections</code> and controls within <code>ObjectPageSections</code>, they might be stashed after the					key user removes them. In this case, the stashed control (i.e. the <code>ObjectPageSection</code>) will remain as an empty					placeholder, but any controls within the stashed control will be removed. This means that the control is not processed and					therefore not instantiated. Your code shouldn't break in this case.</p></div></div>			<p></p>			<p>It's okay to create additional controls dynamically, for example, as a result of user interaction. If you dynamically add controls to				the UI, make sure to set all properties before you add them to an aggregation of a parent control, ideally as part of the constructor.				With this, you prevent that changes that key user made to the control are overridden.</p>			<div class="note tip  "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
