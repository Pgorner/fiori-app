			<h2 class="title ">Overview</h2>
			<section>
				<h3 class="title ">Smart Composite Controls</h3>
				<p>The <code>sap.ui.mdc</code> applications for library aims at providing a predefined user
					experience through metadata-driven UI controls. The generic behavior of those
					controls is decoupled from the application- or protocol-specific requirements to
					ensure a flexible usage of those controls independent of the back-end
					technology. The
					well-known
						SAPUI5 key
					features and development concepts are supported out of the
					box.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3 class="title ">Extensibility of APIs</h3>
				<p>The controls can be extended by implementable delegates and well-defined APIs for metadata in
					a unified format. They facilitate XML pre-processing and include as much network
					request-dependent information in the XML view cache as possible to speed up the
					application startup. </p>

				<h3 class="title ">Adaptation via
						SAPUI5
					Flexibility</h3>
				<div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
					</p><p>SAPUI5 flexibility
						features, such as end user personalization and key user adaptation, only
						work when using SAPUI5 applications
						hosted on SAP BTP, SAP S/4HANA, or ABAP platform. For more information, see
							<a href="https://help.sap.com/docs/UI5_FLEXIBILITY/430e2c1a4ff241bc8162df4bf51e0730/41ada93054994698ab9067855bb85fe1.html" title="https://help.sap.com/docs/UI5_FLEXIBILITY/430e2c1a4ff241bc8162df4bf51e0730/41ada93054994698ab9067855bb85fe1.html" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Features and Availability</a>.</p>
				<p></p></div></div>
				<p>The controls offer integrated end user personalization and key user adaptation
					and support private, shared, and key user variants. A seamless integration with
					the <code>sap.ui.fl</code> library is built into the
						<code>sap.ui.mdc</code> controls, which enables the previously mentioned
					features while improving application performance at the same time.</p>

			<h2 class="title ">Architecture</h2>
			<section>
				<h3 class="title ">Controls and Delegates</h3>
				<p>Each <code>sap.ui.mdc</code> control consists of a central control part and a
					delegate that implements the non-generic parts, such as protocol- and model- or
					application-specific requirements. The implemented delegate encapsulates network
					requests and the retrieval of cacheable information. </p>
				<p>Controls and delegates can be extended from the base classes by the
					developers
					leveraging the predefined default behavior. Only in combination with a delegate
					does a control offer all the advantages outlined initially.</p>
				<p>The following graphic illustrates this behavior: </p>
				<div><div class="fig"><img src="loio175859c197a7491d91ab81c09b3104d1_LowRes.png" title="Each control is used in combination with a delegate. Controls and their related delegates form a unit that can then be used as described and together with other controls and their respective delegates." alt="Each control is used in combination with a delegate. Controls and their related delegates form a unit that can then be used as described and together with other controls and their respective delegates." usemap="#"></div></div>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3 class="title ">Metadata APIs</h3>
				<p>As <code>sap.ui.mdc</code> controls are supposed to work metadata-driven,
					service-specific metadata is translated into <code>propertyInfo</code>
					objects. They can include basic information, such as a label for a
						<code>Field</code> control, but also more intricate information, such as
					the information if a table column supports sorting. The
						<code>propertyInfo</code> objects are provided
					by
					the application via the delegate but can also be provided at XML view level to
					be cached and hence speed up the initial rendering.</p>
				<p>The following graphic illustrates this behavior:</p>
				<div><div class="fig"><img src="loioa36e1106565d48c08b10fafca377f66a_LowRes.png" title="The control fetches data from the delegate and retrieves this metadata from a related PropertyInfo object via the delegate. " alt="The control fetches data from the delegate and retrieves this metadata from a related PropertyInfo object via the delegate. " usemap="#"></div></div>

				<h3 class="title ">
					SAPUI5 Flexibility
					Integration</h3>
				<p>For the integration of SAPUI5
					flexibility and its features, the delegates offer specific and
					easy-to-adopt
					APIs that enable personalization changes, such as adding items to aggregations
					or removing them, for example, from table columns, as well as applying filtering
					or sorting. </p>
				<p>The integration of SAPUI5 flexibility is taken over by the <code>sap.m.p13n.Engine</code>. It can
					also be used stand-alone to enable personalization including persistency of any
						SAPUI5
					control.</p>
				<p>The following graphic shows the personalization process: </p>
				<div><div class="fig"><img src="loio82a3a3262e9c42c59b0a3ac1e15f73e5_LowRes.png" title="The controls and their delegates work together with the " alt="The controls and their delegates work together with the " usemap="#"></div></div>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3 class="title ">Built-in Performance Advantages</h3>
				<p>The application startup time benefits from the metadata APIs and the SAPUI5 flexibility
					integration. The XML view cache can store the results of the delegate's metadata
					processing and the subsequent modification of the XML view by SAPUI5 flexibility change
					handlers. This behavior should result in a significantly improved performance
					and fewer requests to the back end, which makes applications cost-efficient.</p>
				<p>The following graphic illustrates this behavior:</p>
				<div><div class="fig"><img src="loio7a21af4655af428f8791f31a98c89513_LowRes.png" title="Based on the cache check in the XML view, the delegate fetches the metadata. After that, the XML view is modified by SAPUI5 flexibility, which results in the creation of a control using the cached scenario." alt="Based on the cache check in the XML view, the delegate fetches the metadata.
