			<h2 class="title ">Deprecated Artifacts</h2>
			<p>If an artifact is no longer developed, we mark it as deprecated. Usually, the deprecated artifact is replaced by a newer and better
				alternative.</p>
			<p>You can usually still use deprecated artifacts for a while - they will remain part of the
				codeline until they are removed. However: This is not recommended since you can't
				expect the artifact to be developed any further. In addition, any deprecated
				artifact can be removed from the codeline entirely with one of the next SAPUI5 releases. If you
				update your app to a SAPUI5 version that
				doesn't contain the deprecated artifact any longer, your app will potentially
				break.</p>

				the officially delivered scope that is guaranteed for future releases. Their purpose
				is to get user feedback at an early point of time, allowing customers or partners to
