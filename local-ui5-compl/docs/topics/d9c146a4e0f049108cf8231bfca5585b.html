					Caution
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
                </p><p>Use app extensions with caution and only if you cannot produce the required
                    behavior by other means, such as manifest settings or annotations. To correctly
                    integrate your app extension coding with SAP Fiori elements, use
                    only the <code>extensionAPI</code> of SAP Fiori elements. For
                    more information, see <a href="topic/bd2994b69ef542998becbc69ab093f7e" title="The extensionAPI consists of several elements that are described below. It can be used for the list report and object page." class="sap-doc">Using the extensionAPI</a>.</p>
                <p>After you've created an app extension, its display (for example, control
                    placement and layout) and system behavior (for example, model and binding usage,
                    busy handling) lies within the application's responsibility. SAP Fiori elements
                    provides support only for the official <code>extensionAPI</code> functions.
                    Don't access or manipulate controls, properties, models, or other internal
                    objects created by the SAP Fiori elements
                    framework.</p>

			<h2 class="title ">Using the Standard SAPUI5 API</h2>
			<p>In extension coding, you can use the standard SAPUI5 programming API. However, you
				should do so with care. For more information, see <a href="topic/403c050da4ae4566b6aafec2bc590389" title="SAPUI5 uses extension points for extending standard views with custom content. The assignment of a custom view to an extension point is done in component customizing." class="sap-doc">View Extension</a>.</p>
			<p>After you have defined a view extension, you can access and modify the properties of all UI elements defined within these extensions
				(such as changing the visibility). You can access the elements you have created by their ID. However, you must not access any UI
				elements that are not defined within your view extensions.</p><div class="note caution  "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Caution
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>If you do not adhere to this guideline, your app may
					not work with future SAPUI5 versions because SAP Fiori elements might

			<h2 class="title ">Notes on Models</h2>
			<p>Several models (instances of <code>sap.ui.model.Model</code>) are attached to the list report and object page, and analytical list
				page template artifacts.</p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">
					<span class="emphasis">OData Model</span>
					<p>The most prominent is the default model. This is the OData model specified in the <code>manifest.json</code> file. You can
						use this model for data-binding in your own view extensions.</p><p>Access the model (through the standard SAPUI5 API methods) with care, since side effects may interfere with
						the template coding that also uses this model.</p></li>
				<li class="li">
					<span class="emphasis">UI Model</span>
					<p>Each view has its own model attached that has the name <code>ui</code>. This model can be used in view and controller
						extensions for read purposes.</p><p>Note that it is also possible to register changes to these properties. However, the logic
						that determines at which point in time these properties are set and reset can still be changed.</p><div class="note caution  "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Caution
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p> It is
						strictly forbidden to perform any change operations on the properties of the UI model.</p></div></div></li>

					<span class="emphasis">SAP Fiori Elements Private Model</span>
					<p>Additional model that is attached to each view that contains properties used for internal purposes within the
						templates.</p><div class="note caution  "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Caution
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p> It is strictly forbidden to access this model in any way. Do not access any model other
						than the default model and the <code>ui</code> model unless you have attached it to the <code>ManagedObject</code>
						yourself.</p></div></div></li>
				<li class="li">
					<span class="emphasis">Application-Specific Models</span>
					<p>You may want to define your own JSON model and attach it to UI elements. You can do this easily if the model is attached to a
						UI element that exists only within the scope of an extension. However, use models that are attached to a higher level (for
						example, to the whole view) only if absolutely necessary. In this case, you should use a name containing your own namespace to
						clearly separate this model from models defined by other parts of the framework.</p>

				<li class="li">
					<p>For the extension of any system logic or functions that are related to
						existing controls or components provided by SAP Fiori elements, always use
						the extensionAPI. It is the official interface between the actual extension
						and the functions provided by SAP Fiori elements.
						SAP guarantees implemented system behavior, functions, and compatibility
						only if the official interface is used correctly. This is the prerequisite
						for receiving the necessary support and quality assurance.</p>

				<li class="li">Services provided by the namespace <code>sap.ui.generic.app</code> or <code>sap.fe.navigation</code>, since these services are
					intended for use only by freestyle SAPUI5 apps or within the generic
					list report and object page and analytical list page template implementation. </li>
				<li class="li">Services provided directly by the namespace
						<code>sap.ui.generic.template</code>. Unwanted side effects may occur if
					two layers (template coding and extension coding) access these services at the

				<h3 class="title ">Notes on Models</h3>
				<p>Access the model (through the standard SAPUI5 API methods) with
					care, since side effects may interfere with the template coding that also uses
					this model.</p>
				<p>This applies in particular to function imports. Therefore, use method
						<code>invokeActions</code> of the extension API to call function
					imports. </p>
			</section><section>
				<h3 class="title ">UI Model</h3>
				<p>This model contains the following properties, all of which have Boolean values:
