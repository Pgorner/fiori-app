			the XML and before data is stored in the view cache.</p><p>The hook is called separately for all controls (HTMLElements) for each change handler that applied a change on that control, even if the handler
			threw an error during the apply process.</p><p>It's always called after all changes for the control have been applied. It's only called once if multiple changes of the same type were applied
			on the same control.</p><p>This hook can be used for performance improvements. Example: Data is retrieved and used by more than one change handler. To prevent multiple
			superfluous calls to the data source, the data is stored in the XML tree as custom data . The <code>onAfterXMLChangeProcessing</code> hook is then used
			to remove the custom data before the view-cache is created from the XML tree.</p><section class="contentInSection hidden"><h2>In this section:</h2></section><section class="familyLinks"><div class="parentLink hidden"><br><strong>Parent topic: </strong></div><div class="previousLink hidden"><br><strong>Previous: </strong></div><div class="nextLink hidden"><br><strong>Next: </strong></div></section><section class="hidden relatedLinks "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon title"><h2>Related information</h2></div><ul class="fig"></ul></section></div></section></div></body></html>
