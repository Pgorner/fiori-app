		offers advanced theming concepts and functions which can be used optionally. These concepts
		are outlined in detail below.</div><section id="section_CSS">
			<h2 class="title ">CSS Variables, Functions, and More</h2>
			<p>SAPUI5 provides a set of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*" title="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CSS custom properties</a> which
				allows you to make your application or custom controls theming-aware. The CSS custom properties are provided by the <a href="https://github.com/SAP/theming-base-content" title="https://github.com/SAP/theming-base-content" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAP Theming Base Content</a>. It contains all
				necessary data to connect to the SAP global theming infrastructure. The content exposes the central set of colors, metrics, and
				resources of a theme. SAPUI5 applications or custom controls can easily
				make use of the CSS custom properties of the SAP Theming Base Content. This concept contributes to a consistent way of implementing
				and changing the styles. CSS provides a lot of additional features like calculations, nesting, and more.</p>
			<p>Here is the syntax:</p>
			<section><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><div class="copyButton"><span style="display: none;">Hidden</span></div><div class="codeblock-wrapper"><pre class="codeblock">button {
    color: var(--sapButton_TextColor); /* buttons will automatically have the current text color, which is '#000000' right now */
    [...]
}</pre></div></div></section>
			<p>The browser then takes care of substituting all references to a CSS custom property by the current value of this variable. Every time a CSS
				custom property is changed at runtime, it will affect all usages.</p>
			<p>Additionally, a specific theme can modify the CSS custom property values given by the base theme. So a control can just define its text color to
				use <code>--sapButton_TextColor</code> by default, which will automatically take care of applying the correct color for every
				theme or user modification: The theme generation will create one CSS file per theme, and the usage of the CSS custom property ensures
				that the theme-dependent value will always be taken into account. A visually very different theme can easily be created by simply
				changing a number of colors.</p>
			<p>While every library and control can introduce their own CSS custom properties, those provided by the SAP Theming Base Content are the most
				important. Ideally, there should only be a few of them, and they should be simple enough to be understood by most end users (similar
				to what the Windows operating system offers end users), but still cover as many aspects of the visual appearance as necessary to make
				them sufficient for most customer-required theme modifications.  To be theming-aware, these CSS custom properties are ideally based on
				existing ones provided by the SAP Theming Base Content.</p>
			<p>Additional benefits of CSS custom properties are, for example:</p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">They promote modular and maintainable code by centralizing common values in one place.</li>
				<li class="li">Although they can be manipulated via code at runtime without the need of a dedicated SAPUI5 re-rendering step, they must not be manipulated globally.<div class="note tip  "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Tip
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
						</p><p>All controls that use the Parameters API might require a re-rendering after an SAP CSS custom property has been changed
							(e.g. charts)!</p>
					<p></p></div></div></li>
				<li class="li">They facilitate cascading and inheritance, allowing you to define values that can be inherited by child elements.</li>
				<li class="li">They can be used to generically build simple styling tools that allow for a limited degree of freedom (=changing the CSS custom property
					values). The UI theme designer is an example of such a tool.</li>
				<li class="li">They can also be linked to metadata, for example, to which group of colors they
					belong, to which colors they need to have some visual contrast.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="title ">Compilation of One CSS File</h2>
			<p>SAPUI5 CSS generation merges all CSS files of a control library into
					<span class="emphasis">one</span> file that is loaded at runtime, thus increasing the performance.</p>
			<p>Here are some of the reasons why you would not want to have all styles defined within
				one file during development:</p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">Clear separation between the styles for different controls, which helps to estimate and test
					the impact of a CSS modification</li>
				<li class="li">Keeping the door open for future optimization regarding runtime performance and data
					transfer by tailoring CSS files on server side that only contain the CSS
					required on the current application page</li>
			</ul>
		</section><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Optimization and Compression of CSS Size </h2>
			<p>For performance reasons, the SAPUI5 CSS generation can optionally remove all comments and unnecessary whitespace and
				can compress verbose declarations into a more compact format.</p>
		</section><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Base Theme for Generic Style</h2>
			<p>While some of the style and layout applied using CSS clearly depends on the current theme, and
				customers are likely to modify such style rules, there are other style rules that
				are required for a control to work properly and unlikely to differ for different
				themes. Examples are the overflow behavior, the positioning of popup elements, the
				mouse cursor type, the display mode, and others.</p>
			<p>SAPUI5 promotes and supports keeping those style definitions in the so-called base theme,
				which serves as a common base for all themes.</p>
			<p>Themes are built upon this base style that defines their specific visual design by applying
				colors and images, sizes and fonts. SAPUI5 theme generation
				takes care of combining the base theme with the specific theme for each generated
				theme CSS file. Because the specific CSS is appended to the base theme, a specific
				theme can always override styles defined in the base theme. If this step is required
				often, the respective style declaration should probably not be located in the base
				theme.</p>
			<p>Any style declarations which are referencing CSS variables (at least those common ones defined
				in the base theme) can also be done in the base theme, and it is sufficient to do it
				only there: The CSS generation will apply the correct value for each respective
				theme. So this split between base theme and specific themes avoids duplicate
				creation and maintenance of CSS parts which are common for all themes and keeps the
				CSS files that need to be written for any new theme smaller.</p>
		</section><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Generic Right-to-Left Support </h2>
			<p>For some countries, right-to-left (RTL) text mode needs to be supported. In order to
				avoid the need to create a completely new set of CSS files for those countries, SAPUI5 supports generic
				RTL generation. Basically, this involves switching the right and left margins and
				mirroring everything else (including CSS3 rotations, and so on).</p>
			<p>Everything else that is not covered by this automatic transformation can be fixed by
				using style rules that are only applied in the RTL case.</p>
			<p>If you override RTL-specific attributes like text alignment, positioning and so on,
				you have to write the RTL equivalent into your application CSS. The attributes below
				are critical for RTL support:</p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li"><code>float</code></li>
				<li class="li"><code>clear</code></li>
				<li class="li"><code>text-align</code></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following attributes require special attention:</p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li"><code>margin</code></li>
				<li class="li"><code>padding</code></li>
				<li class="li"><code>border</code></li>
				<li class="li"><code>background-position</code></li>
				<li class="li"><code>position</code> (right/left)</li>
				<li class="li"><code>text-indent</code></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Depending on the values, these latter attributes might also need to be mirrored. As
				applications running in RTL mode add a <code>dir</code> attribute to the HTML
				tag in the DOM, custom styles that have to be written can use the following selector
				to handle RTL-specific styling:</p>
			<section><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><div class="copyButton"><span style="display: none;">Hidden</span></div><div class="codeblock-wrapper"><pre class="codeblock">html[dir="rtl"]  .myselector {
}</pre></div></div></section>
